# ADC_Project
We have discussed in project the secures wireless communication in detail. 
This process is very useful in modern applications of wireless communication. 
First of all, we entered the message from keyboard. 
This message is encrypted and then it is transmitted using radio frequency transmitter. 
The characters which are entered at the transmitter will also be displayed on the serial monitor for our convenience and so that we can enter our data in easier way. 
At the receiver when the encrypted message is received then this message is decrypted by the microcontroller and is displayed on the serial monitor.
The mode of communication that we have used in our project is simplex data transmission over radio frequency.
